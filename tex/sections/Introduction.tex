\section{NASA Magnetospheric MultiScale Mission}
\label{sec:NASAMagnetosphericMultiScaleMission}

NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) Mission is a Solar Terrestrial probe mission scheduled for launch in October 2014 \cite{mms_website}.  The mission consists of four identical satellites orbiting the Earth in a constellation formation flight.  Construction of the satellites is occurring at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center where they are being equipped to study the microphysics of magnetic reconnection events within the Earth's magnetic fields.

A reconnection event occurs when magnetic field lines cross allowing energetic particles to traverse from interstellar space into the Earth's magnetosphere releasing large quantities of heat and kinetic energy.  The diffusion region of a reconnection event starts on the day side magnetopause an quickly folds over to the Earth's magnetotail (Figure \ref{fig:magneticfields}).  This region is only 1-10 km in size but can travel at 10-100 km/hr \cite{swri} making it extremely difficult to measure.  Effects of a reconnection event are regularly experienced via the aurora borealis, interference with spacecraft GPS systems, and disruptions to electrical grids and communication networks.

Despite the widely experienced effects of reconnection events, very little about the microphysics inside its the diffusion region has been adequately measured.  Magnetometers, spectrometers, and other equipment currently in orbit are only able to capture a small fraction of the event's behavior.  Most equipment collect data from a single point or direction in space or some can get a 360 view of space by applying a slow spin to the spacecraft.  Both of these measurement methods are insufficient at capturing the structure of the diffusion region as it passes.

MMS's four satellites will be equipped with instrumentation mounted at the end of six boom extending out from the spacecraft's body along each major axis.  Four boom are the Spin Plane Double Probes (SDP) and two Axial Double Probes (ADP).  This configuration along with high resolution electron and ion spectrometers gives the constellation a new insight into the internal structure of the diffusion region.  The instrumentation at the ends of the boom are an advantage to the science portion of the mission, but create a unique challenge for the Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS).  The satellites are spin stabilized at a rate of 3 rpm.  Disturbances to the rotation could translate into undesirable boom dynamics and nutations off the spin plane.



% Science questions to answer \cite{mms_website}
%     What determines when reconnection starts and how fast it proceeds?
%     What is the structure of the diffusion region?
%     How do the plasmas and magnetic fields disconnect and reconnect in the diffusion regions?
%     What role do the electrons play in facilitating reconnection?
%     What is the role of turbulence in the reconnection process?
%     How does reconnection lead to the acceleration of particles to high energies?

% adjacent magnetic fields generally have significaltly different orientations such that when they intersect, a large amount of energy is dispursed within a small region in the form of heat and kinetic energy.  The region = diffuision region

% orbits planned to pass through the upstream and downstream magnetic reconnection sites
% 1) day side - solar wind field lines connection
% 2) down stream -
% 3) plasma travels down and causes the Arura
% through magnetospheric reconnection, portals allow energetic particles to traverse from outside to the interior of the magnetosphere
% predict when solar space weather within the magnetosphere and if they will affect orbiting satellites
% adverse space weather within the magnetosphere can negatively impace spacecraft system health GPS, induce disruptive current in electrical grids, communictaions, increased radiation exposure on trans-polar flights
