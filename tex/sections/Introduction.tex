\section{NASA Magnetospheric MultiScale Mission}
\label{sec:NASAMagnetosphericMultiScaleMission}

NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) Mission is a Solar Terrestrial probe mission scheduled for launch in March 2015 \cite{mms_website}.  The mission consists of four identical satellites orbiting the Earth in a constellation formation flight.  Construction of the satellites is occurring at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) where they are being equipped to study the microphysics of magnetic reconnection events within the Earth's magnetic fields.

\end{figure}

A reconnection event occurs when magnetic field lines cross allowing energetic particles to traverse from interstellar space into the Earth's magnetosphere releasing large quantities of heat and kinetic energy.  The diffusion region of a reconnection event starts on the day side magnetopause and quickly folds over to the Earth's magnetotail (Figure \ref{fig:magneticfields}).  This region is only 1-10 km in size but can travel at 10-100 km/hr \cite{swri} making it extremely difficult to measure.  Effects of a reconnection event are regularly experienced via the aurora borealis, interference with spacecraft GPS systems, and disruptions to electrical grids and communication networks.

  \label{fig:magneticfields}
\end{figure}

Despite the widely experienced effects of reconnection events, very little about the microphysics inside its the diffusion region has been adequately measured.  Magnetometers, spectrometers, and other equipment currently in orbit are only able to capture a small fraction of the event's behavior.  Most equipment collect data from a single point or direction in space or some can get a $360^o$ view of space by applying a slow spin to the spacecraft.  Both of these measurement methods are insufficient at capturing the structure of the diffusion region as it passes.

MMS's four satellites are equipped with instrumentation mounted at the end of six boom extending out from the spacecraft's body along each major axis.  Four boom are the Spin Plane Double Probes (SDP) and two Axial Double Probes (ADP).  Figure \ref{fig:booms}, created by Neil Mushaweh \ref{mushawehthesis}, shows a scale model of one of the MMS satellites.  Mushaweh conducted research on finite element analysis of the boom dynamics and simulation based comparisons of nonlinear observer-based controllers.  His research unveiled a major shortcoming with current numerical simulation software needed for the rotating body with flexible booms.

\begin{quote}{``While attempting to rotate the satellite model at 3 rotations per minute about [the $z$-axis], the inability of the software to transform coordinates after 90 degrees of rotation caused the rotation to cease. When such constraints on coordinate transformations are removed, or when the coordinate system is changed to cylindrical coordinates, the model began to expand in the radial direction. These inaccurate simulation results indicate that there are numerical instabilities that occur in dynamic transient simulations in which rotational motion is experienced. This numerical instability was confirmed by MSC support engineers, and proven to be insurmountable in the scope of this research. Overcoming this numerical instability in dynamic transient analysis through future research could have implications on several design and analysis situations in which coordinate transformations can cause inaccurate results.''~\cite{mushawehthesis}}\end{quote}

  \caption{MMS Boom Configuration \ref{mushawehthesis}}
  \label{fig:booms}
\end{figure}

This configuration along with high resolution electron and ion spectrometers gives the constellation a new insight into the internal structure of the diffusion region.  The instrumentation at the ends of the boom are an advantage to the science portion of the mission but create a unique challenge for the Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS).  The satellites are spin-stabilized at a rate of 3 rpm.  Disturbances to the rotation could translate into undesirable boom dynamics and nutations.

\section{Research Objective}
\label{sec:ResearchObjective}

This thesis utilizes an experimental table top satellite prototype (NASA TableSat1A) to span two main efforts.  The first is to create a physical model of a satellite for NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) Mission in order to validate and compare varied gyroless attitude determination and control systems (ADCS) techniques.  The ADCS maintains the TableSat constant 3 rpm rotation, prevents boom oscillations, and detects and corrects for unwanted nutation.  The second effort is a software system that can be used to implement theoretical and experimental models.  The system provides near ``real-time'' feedback of the system's states, and allows for ``on-the-fly'' modification to control parameters.  The system is specifically designed such that any control systems engineer is able to customize and extend its functionality without substantial programming expertise.

\section{Past Work}
\label{sec:PastWork}

This work is a direct extension off of Vess' research \cite{vessthesis} and using TableSat through a Numerical Simulation Software (NSS) like Matlab Simulink or Octave and onboard flight controllers to demonstrate fundamentals of control theory.  The TableSat experimental design is modified to study the system dynamics of the instrument booms and nutation actuators in NASA's MMS mission satellites.  Previous experimental \cite{tsat1b} \cite{tsat1c} \cite{tsat2} and analytical \cite{mushawehthesis} ADCS work at University of New Hampshire's Advanced Control Lab (ACL) has been performed targeting the NASA MMS mission.  The TableSat platform or similar derivations have also been adapted in investigate other areas of research including embedded systems development \cite{tablesat_xuml} and fault tolerant control \cite{tablesat_object_bench} \cite{nanjing_university}.


\section{Analytical and Experimental Test Bed}
\label{sec:AnalyticalandExperimentalTestbed}

The test bed used for analytical simulations and experimental validation consists of a base station (laptop) which handles the observer-based controller, and UNH's NASA MMS TableSat 1A which is a wireless limited 3-DOF rotation (full spin and limited nutation) test bed.  Concurrent work has been accomplished in tandem with this research to make improvements to the capabilities of the TableSat system including UNH TableSat 1C \cite{tsat1c} which improves actuator design and reduces rotational friction, and UNH TableSat 2 \cite{tsat2} which adds translation in a plane.

\section{Thesis Contributions}
\label{sec:ThesisContributions}

The research from Vess and Mushaweh illustrate the need for an observer-based controller software system that could be used to perform analytical simulations with spin-stabilized satellites as well as control of their experimental counterpart all while maintaining a high degree of numerical stability.

\subsection{Numerical Stability for Rotational Motion}
\label{subsec:NumericalStabilityforRotationalMotion}

Mushaweh's research using MSC Marc Mentat 2005 r3 and MATLAB / \textit{Simulink}\textsuperscript{TM} R2006a concluded that they were insufficient for simulating the dynamics that exist in a rotating system such as the NASA MMS satellite.  This research contributes and/or incorporates the following attributes into its software to address this deficiency.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Quaternion Multiplicative Corrections}: Ensures numerical stability in rotating systems
  \item \textbf{Adaptive Step Algorithms}: Corrects for inconsistent step sizes in simulations or experiments
  \item \textbf{Quaternion Decomposition}: Decouples rotation and nutation control
  \item \textbf{$\theta$ Multiplier with Quaternion Vector Balancing}: Linearly scales quaternion attitude measures used in state corrections without breaking the unit quaternion restriction
  \item \textbf{Euler Axis Based Moments}: Utilizes the quaternion's Euler axis and angular displacement to calculate linearly scaled control moments
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reusable Software}
\label{subsec:ReusableSoftware}

Since this is an active field of research, future research teams will benefit from the ability to reuse the software created for this thesis in a wide variety of analytical simulations and experimental testing on rotating systems.  In order to make this software an attractive alternative to traditional Numerical Simulation Software, the following principles were incorporated into its design.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Concurrent Estimation/Control Algorithms}: Evaluation of multiple estimation and control methods
  \item \textbf{``Run-time'' interface}: Access and visualize the internal state of the control system while running
  \item \textbf{Variable System Clock}: Alter the speed of simulations to compress long simulations or inspect state changes is slow motion
  \item \textbf{Python}: Written in a widely used and expressive language that is easy to learn, comes with ``batteries-included'', and is viable for high performance applications.
  \item \textbf{Modular Design}: Additional estimation or control algorithms or system models can be written and plugged into the existing system
  \item \textbf{Source Agnostic Control System}: Observer-based controller logic can be reused to control a variety of rotating system (simulated and physical)
  \item \textbf{MIT License}: Software will be released publicly on acceptance of this thesis under a MIT License
