\label{chap:ObserverBasedControls}

Chapter \ref{chap:UNHTableSat1A} detailed how TableSat's sensor readings could be quantified and represented in terms of engineering units.  Chapter \ref{chap:SatelliteAttitudeDynamicsAndKinematics} established the state representation of the system and the chosen dynamic equations used to model it's behavior.  This chapter will focus on the estimation techniques to improve the accuracy of the state representations, and control techniques to guide the system into the desired state.
