\section{FUTURE WORK}
\label{chap:FutureWork}


Future work includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a better filtering method such as an extended kalman filter.
\item Improve the gradient descent algorithm for parameter tuning.
\item Modify the Actuator module \ref{code:TSatPy/Actuator.py} to operate pneumatic thrusters and calculate pulse width modulations instead of continuous variable voltages.
\item Port the tPlot library from MATLAB to Python for enhanced visualizations
\item Release the source code at https://github.com/MathYourLife under an MIT license.
\item Complete the configuration of the python ADCS ``twisted'' daemon to open a RESTful API interface to query the system's state.
\item Upgrade the three-axis magnetometer nutation to one with a less noisy sensor readings.
\item Investigate use of coarse sun sensors for nutation detection.
\item Port the ADCS to a lighter test platform with less friction.
\item Investigate with estimator and/or controller scheduling.
\item Improve the unit test coverage on the TSatPy library.
\end{itemize}
