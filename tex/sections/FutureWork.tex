\section{FUTURE WORK}
\label{chap:FutureWork}


Future work includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of a better filtering method such as an extended kalman filter.
\item Improve the gradient descent algorithm for parameter tuning.
\item Modifying the Actuator module \ref{code:TSatPy/Actuator.py} to operate pneumatic thrusters and calculate pulse width modulations instead of continuous variable voltages.
\item Porting of the tPlot library from Matlab to Python for enhanced visualizations
\item Release of the source code at https://github.com/MathYourLife/TSatPy under an MIT license.
\item Complete the configuration of the twisted daemon to open a RESTful interface to query the system's state.
\item Upgrade the three-axis magnetometer nutation to one with a less noisy sensor readings.
\item Investigate use of coarse sun sensors for nutation detection.
\item Port the ADCS to a lighter and test platform with less friction.
\item Experiment with estimator and/or controller scheduling.
\item Improving the unit test coverage on the TSatPy library.
\end{itemize}
