\label{chap:Conclusions}

The goal of this thesis was to determine the viability of the TableSat 1A's platform for comparison and experimental verification of various observer-based controllers.

\TODO{Finish this}

Estimator:
  SMO bettor for initial response
  Toss up between SMO/PID for ss response, SMO update state sooner, PID less error


Controller:
  SMC performs far better with perfect estimates


State Error
  Multiplicative quaternion corrections
  Scaling based or the represented angle rather than the quaternion scalar
  Estimating the vector quantities of the quaternion can interfere with the angular component, only control the use of the angular component (fewer parameters to tune)
