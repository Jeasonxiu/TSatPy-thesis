\chapter{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{chap:Conclusions}

The goal of this thesis was to determine the viability of the TableSat 1A's platform for comparison and experimental verification of various observer-based controllers.

\TODO{Finish this}

Estimator:
  SMO bettor for initial response
  Toss up between SMO/PID for ss response, SMO update state sooner, PID less error

Controller:
  SMC rate controller performs far better with perfect estimates

State Error
  Multiplicative quaternion corrections
  Scaling based or the represented angle rather than the quaternion scalar
  Estimating the vector quantities of the quaternion can interfere with the angular component, only control the use of the angular component (fewer parameters to tune)

Python so much better than matlab for programming
Slow progress to establish the foundation, but became faster as building blocks were created and vetted through unit tests

run-time feedback ++

Attitude control
  Surprising level of control with just a single gain in a P-controller!!!


Antipodal response with P-attitude and body rate control
