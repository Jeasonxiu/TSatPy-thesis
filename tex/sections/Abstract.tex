This thesis utilizes an experimental tabletop satellite (TableSat) to span two main efforts.  First is to create a physical model of a satellite from NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) Mission in order to validate and compare varied gyroless attitude determination and control (ADC) techniques.  The ADC systems must keep the TableSat rotating at a constant 3 rpm, prevent boom oscillations, and correct for detected nutations out of the spin plane.  The second goal is to produce a software system that can be used to run against both theoretical simulations and multiple evolutions of experimental models.  The system should provide near ``real-time'' feedback of the system's state, allow for on-the-fly modification to control parameters, and be designed such that individuals specializing in control systems could customize and extend its functionality without substantial computer science expertise.
