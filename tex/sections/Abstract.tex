This thesis utilizes an experimental tabletop satellite (TableSat) to span three main efforts.  First is to create a physical model of a satellite from NASA's Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) Mission in order to validate and compare varied gyroless attitude determination and control (ADC) techniques.  The ADC systems must keep the TableSat rotating at a constant 3 rpm, prevent boom oscillations, and correct for detected nutations off the spin plane.  The second goal is to produce a software system that can be used to run against both theoretical simulations and experimental models.  The third goal is improve TableSat's use as an outreach tool.  The system should provide near ``real-time'' feedback of the system's state, allow for on-the-fly modification to control parameters, and be designed such that a individuals specializing in control systems could customize and extend its functionality without substantial computer science expertise.
